# Laundry is fun!

## Directions
I would like an SPA that matches the description below. Reading through the description should get you the ideas of what it supposed to accomplish. Some pieces may be ambiguous or even missing but I value your product/feature decisions (we're a team right?).

I'd like the app to be built in either Angular or React but other than that the way you accomplish this is up to you. It doesn't need to look beautiful but I'd  like it to look nice and make sense to use.

Commit/comment when/how you naturally would and when you're finished submit a pull request so I can check it out. If this takes you longer than 4hrs I would say submit what you have because I'll have enough to go off of at that point.

Any questions feel free to ping me

## Description

Everyone loves doing laundry. They love it so much they want to do it during their spare time on the world wide web. 

I would like an app where I can add dirty clothes to my washing machine, add some soap, and then hit the start button to clean my clothes. I'm a coal miner so my dirty clothes get very dark and smokey. It's nice that my soap is a bright blue color that stands out because a serving of soap only cleans 5 pieces of clothing. I don't know about you but I love staring at the clothes spinning around in the machine. Its hypnotizing.

I spent some serious coin on a Samsung WA52J8700AW/A2 so a piece of clothing only needs to be in the washing machine for 15 seconds until its clean. I had to get my old washing machine of the same model replaced because I ran into a problem where when it was in the middle of cleaning a dozen pieces of clothing and I added some more it would shake so violently I had remove partially clean pieces of clothing until I had less than a dozen in there for it to start again (http://www.ibtimes.com/samsung-washing-machine-recall-2016-full-list-models-affected-how-get-refund-2443441). I hope this replacement doesn't have that same issue. Samsung has a good track record right?
